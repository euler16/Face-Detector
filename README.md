# Face-Recognizer
A Near "from scratch" implementation of face recognition system.

# TO-DO
A few things were left to be done in future
1.improve the interface
	Apart from header files everything else is scattered(apologies)
2.Bring in GUI
3.Use a better classification algorithm

# Dataset obtained from:-
	Olivetti Research Laboratory in Cambridge, UK

# Future motivation:-
implement a robust and Intelligent visualisation system.

# Prerequisites:-
COE-115 - Quantum Mechanics :D
COE-112 - Linear Algebra (Matrices and Determinants)

# Features not implemented from scratch:-
1.Mat datatype (required for fast matrix calculation)
2.PCA class (required for finding eigenvectors of covariance matrix of the training set)
3.few opencv classes not involved in the Algorithm
4.Haar Cascade classifier (in facedetect.h), used for finding faces in image
