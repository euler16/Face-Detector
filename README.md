# Face-Recognizer
A Near "from scratch" implementation of face recognition system

# TO-DO
A few things were left to be done in future <br>
1.Improve the Interface. Apart from the header files everything else is scattered(apologies). <br>
2.Bring in GUI <br>
3.Use a better classification algorithm <br>

# Dataset obtained from:-
	Olivetti Research Laboratory in Cambridge, UK

# Future motivation:-
Implement a robust and Intelligent visualisation system.

# Prerequisites:-
COE-115 - Quantum Mechanics :D <br>
COE-112 - Linear Algebra (Matrices and Determinants) <br>

# Features not implemented from scratch:-
1.Mat datatype (required for fast matrix calculation) <br>
2.PCA class (required for finding eigenvectors of covariance matrix of the training set) <br>
3.few opencv classes not involved in the Algorithm <br>
4.Haar Cascade classifier (in facedetect.h), used for finding faces in image <br>
